"""Sets up a new major, minor, or patch version bumped release. Commits a version bump 
for the project's version according to the passed "type" argument, adds a new repo tag
based on the bumped project file version, and merges development into main. This causes 
the `lint_checks_and_tests.yml` job to run on main which in turn triggers a run of
`release.yml`.
